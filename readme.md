# Project for Graphic Computation course

This is supposed to be our project, 'Miauzilla'. It will be a _endless runner game_ where the main character is supposed to be a cat with super powers.

## Setup
You must have installed the following modules:

    -   PyOpenGl
    -   glfw
    -   numpy
    -   pyrr

If you haven't already installed them, you can do so by executing the following commands on your terminal:

```
$ sudo pip install PyOpenGL
$ sudo pip install glfw
$ sudo pip install numpy
$ sudo pip install pyrr
```

## Usage

Once you have the dependencies aPyOpenGLlready installed, you can play _Miauzilla_ by running the following command in your terminal (remember you must use _Python 3_ as minimum):

```
$ python miauzilla.py
```

Enjoy :).
